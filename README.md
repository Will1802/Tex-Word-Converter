# Tex-Word-Converter

This project hopes to make it so that a user can easily convert a .tex file to a .docx file. What is the point of this?
- It would allow people who aren't comfortable with using LaTeX to make use of it's typeset
- Many academic articles may be written in LaTeX but some journals require initial drafts be submitted in .docx
- Allowing collaboration/ mergers of documents written in both formats
    - This may be useful if you are writing notes up quickly in word but later wish to add them to a larger document of notes
- Word can be easier for the manipulation of formats
- LaTeX is a far clearer format, if you are working on documents in the long term, you may want to store it like this so it isn't as complicated in binary form (though this may be a stretch)

Most importantly, it is something I find interesting to do!

## Future ideas
- Provide a GUI
- Provide options for similar formats: MD, HTML etc.
